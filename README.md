CNN BASED DEEPLEARNING METHOD FOR BRAIN TUMOUR DETECTION FROM MRI SCANS

   The process of manually examining a large number of MRI images to detect brain tumours is
 both time-consuming and prone to errors. This can negatively impact the quality of patient care and
 consume significant amounts of time due to the sheer volume of image data. Additionally, the visual
 similarity between normal tissue and brain tumour cells makes it difficult to accurately identify tumour
 regions, highlighting the need for a highly accurate automatic detection method.
 
   Our proposed methodology involves using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to segment
 brain tumours from 2D MRI images. We complement this CNN with traditional classifiers and deep
 learning methods, using a diverse set of MRI images that encompass varying tumour characteristics such
 as sizes, locations, shapes, and intensity levels for comprehensive model training. To validate our
 approach, we incorporated the SVM classifier and various activation algorithms such as softmax,
 RMSProp, and sigmoid. We implemented our solution using TensorFlow and Keras in Python, which are
 efficient programming languages.
 
   By using our approach, we can accurately detect brain tumours from MRI images, which can
 help improve patient care and save time for medical professionals. Our method is more efficient and
 accurate than manual examination, and it can be used to detect tumours with varying characteristics. We
 hope that our work will contribute to the development of more effective and efficient methods for
 detecting brain tumours from MRI images.
